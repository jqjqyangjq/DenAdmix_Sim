# DenAdmix_Sim
Simulations to study Denisovan admixture  
Different divergence times between the introgressing Denisovans and the sampled Denisovans, the performance of Admixfrog (Peter 2020) and Hmmix (Skov et al., 2018), and with different ascertainments (for Admixfrog).  
Modern human demographic models taken from Skov et al., 2018, which was further from a previous study. Archaic admixture history based on empirical results  
With Snakefile work flow to replicate and sims, and ipynb to generate the figure for the Manuscript
